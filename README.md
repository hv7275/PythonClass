# 60 Days Python Series

A concise, hands-on 60-day learning path for Python. This repository contains daily Jupyter notebooks, exercises, and small projects designed to build practical skills from beginner to intermediate level.

**Quick Links**

- Repository: `https://github.com/hv7275/60-Days-Python-Series`
- Main runner: `main.py`

## Overview

Each day includes a focused notebook with explanations and practice tasks. Work through the days sequentially, run cells, and try the exercises to reinforce learning.

## Repository Layout (selected)

- `Day_*.ipynb` — Daily notebooks (Day_1.ipynb .. Day_60.ipynb)
- `main.py` — small utilities / entry script for demos
- `utils.py` — helper functions used across notebooks
- `MyUtility/` — convenience package with helpers:
  - `math_utils.py`
  - `random_utils.py`
  - `string_utils.py`

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Python 3.8+ and `pip`.

1. Clone the repo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/hv7275/60-Days-Python-Series.git
cd "class"
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install Jupyter (if needed):

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip; pip install jupyter
```

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

Or open notebooks directly in VS Code with the Jupyter extension.

## How to Use

- Open the notebook for a day, run the cells top-to-bottom.
- Try the exercises at the end of each notebook.
- Use `MyUtility` helpers in examples when appropriate.

## Contributing

- Fork, create a branch (`feature/day-XX`), add or improve a notebook, and open a pull request.
- Ensure notebooks execute without errors (run cells top-to-bottom).
