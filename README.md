# 60 Days Python Series

Welcome to the **60 Days Python Series** — a structured, hands-on learning path that guides you from absolute beginner topics to building practical Python projects. This series is designed to be followed day-by-day with short Jupyter Notebooks, exercises, and mini projects to build fluency and confidence.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide a clear, step-by-step curriculum to learn Python in 60 days.
- Give learners daily practice with notebooks, examples, and exercises.
- Help beginners become comfortable writing real Python code and building mini projects.

## 👩‍🏫 Who This Series Is For

- Absolute beginners who want a practical introduction to Python.
- Students and hobbyists who need a structured routine.
- Developers who want to solidify core Python fundamentals.

## ✅ What You Will Achieve

By the end of the series you will have:

- A strong foundation in Python syntax and core concepts.
- Experience solving problems with expressions, control flow, and data structures.
- Several mini projects and exercises to showcase in a portfolio.

## 📅 Series Duration

This is a 60-day learning plan. Each day contains a focused Jupyter Notebook, practical examples, and exercises. Follow one day at a time — practice makes progress.

## 📘 What This Series Covers

- Python basics
- Variables & data types
- Operators & expressions
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions (including parameters & return values)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dicts)
- File handling (read/write CSV, text)
- Modules & packages
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects)
- Error handling & exceptions
- Working with libraries (NumPy, pandas — optional)
- Debugging & testing basics
- Mini projects and cumulative exercises

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder or notebook. Example structure:

```
Day_01/Day_1.ipynb        # Day 1: Notebook + exercises
Day_02/Day_2.ipynb        # Day 2: Notebook + exercises
...
Day_60/Day_60.ipynb       # Day 60: Final project & wrap-up
README.md
```

Each `Day_NN.ipynb` notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, runnable examples, and practice tasks.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hv7275/60-Days-Python-Series.git
cd 60-Days-Python-Series
```

2. Install Python (3.8+ recommended):

- Windows: download from python.org and enable "Add Python to PATH".
- macOS / Linux: use system package manager or pyenv.

3. Install Jupyter Notebook (or use VS Code's Jupyter support):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
```

4. Open the notebook for the day and run the cells. In the repo root you can run:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

Or open the file directly in VS Code (with the Python and Jupyter extensions) and run the cells inline.

## 📈 Learning Goals

- Write clean, readable Python code.
- Understand and apply core Python concepts.
- Build small projects from scratch.
- Read and manipulate files and data.
- Use basic libraries and structure code into modules.

## 🧠 Who Can Follow This Series?

- Absolute beginners with no prior programming experience.
- School and college students learning Python.
- Coding enthusiasts who want a structured practice plan.
- Developers refreshing fundamentals.
